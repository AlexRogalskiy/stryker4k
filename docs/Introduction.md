Welcome to the documentation for Stryker for Kotlin. Also known as stryker4k.

# Stryker4k

Stryker4k offers you mutation testing for your Kotlin projects. It allows you to test your tests by temporarily inserting changes to your code. Your tests should be able to detect these changes.

A good place to start learning about Stryker4k is our guide on [getting started](https://stryker-mutator.io/docs/stryker4k/Getting-started)
